# Ivokee for Android
Is just another android app.

It is not online right now. I will up it again soon.

The ideia behind this app was "We need a newsfeed like Facebook but only by peoples near you."

This was my first self-published app. Now I open they code for everyone that want to learn implementation of:


1. XMMP Service for Chat

2. asmack (Xmmp Connection)

3. Geolocalization

4. Async Webservice access

5. Facebook Integration

This app works with a simple webservice made by rails that been found [here](https://github.com/CristianOliveiraDaRosa/ivoke_ws)

##Unit Tests

... Need to be implemented yet. (I know... my shame)

##Licence
This project is under the MIT licence.
